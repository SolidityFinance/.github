<!--Methodology -->
## [Smart Contract Audit](https://sourcehat.com/audits) Methodology

We provide affordable yet intensive security audits of smart contracts. Our team of experienced smart contract auditors can perform audits for tokens, crowdsales, NFTs, marketplaces, gambling games, financial protocols, and more! We leverage a combination of static analysis, automated tools, and a robust manual review process to provide industry-leading security recommendations to project teams.

### **Step 1 - Automated Testing**
Simulation of a variety of interactions with your Smart Contract on a test blockchain leveraging a combination of automated test tools and manual testing to determine if any security vulnerabilities exist.

### **Step 2 - In-Depth Manual Review**
Manual line-by-line code reviews to ensure the logic behind each function is sound and safe from common and economic attack vectors. This is the most important and lengthy portion of the audit process; as automated tools often cannot find the nuances that lead to exploits such as flash loan attacks.

### **Step 3 - Resolution of Issues**
Consulting with the team to provide our recommendations to ensure the code's security and optimize its gas efficiency, if possible. We assist project team's in resolve any outstanding issues or implementing our recommendations.

### **Step 4 - Publishing the Audit Report**
Boiling down results and findings into an easy to read report tailored to the project. Our audit reports highlight resolved issues and any risks that exist to the project or its users, along with any remaining suggested remediation measures. Diagrams are included at the end of each report to help users understand the interactions which occur within the project.
